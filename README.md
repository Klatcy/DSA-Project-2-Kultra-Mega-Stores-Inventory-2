## üìò Introduction  
Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) is a retail and wholesale business specializing in office supplies and furniture, headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria. The Abuja division of KMS requested a data analysis to uncover performance insights and drive smarter decision-making using historical order data from 2009 to 2012.

---

## üìä Project Overview  
The objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior, sales trends, shipping efficiency, and profitability using SQL queries. Insights gained from this analysis will guide business strategy, improve logistics, and enhance customer targeting.

---

## üîó Data Source  
The dataset was provided in Excel format and imported into SQL Server. It contains historical order data from 2009 to 2012. Two tables were used:
- **KMS New**: Contains sales, profit, order, and customer details.  
- **Order_Status**: Contains the status of each order (e.g., Returned).

---

## üì¶ About the Dataset  
Key columns in the dataset:
- `Order_ID`
- `Order_Date`, `Ship_Date`
- `Product_Name`, `Product_Category`
- `Customer_Name`, `Customer_Segment`
- `Sales`, `Profit`, `Shipping_Cost`
- `Ship_Mode`, `Order_Priority`
- `Region`
- `Status` (from `Order_Status` table)

---

## üõ† Tools Used  
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**  
- **Microsoft Excel** (for preprocessing)

---

## üßπ Data Cleaning and Preparation  
- Removed null values and duplicates  
- Standardized date formats  
- Ensured relational integrity between `Order_ID` in both tables  
- Validated and corrected data types for numerical fields like `Sales`, `Profit`, and `Shipping_Cost`

---

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Examined distribution of sales across regions  
- Analyzed frequency of product categories  
- Evaluated shipping cost patterns by mode  
- Explored order timelines and delivery lags

ORDER BY Order_Priority, Ship_Mode DESC

Summary of Findings:

Delivery Truck = Cheapest, Slowest

Express Air = Fastest, Most Expensive

Regular Air = Balanced option


> üö® Misalignment Detected:
High-priority orders used slow shipping
Low-priority orders used expensive methods
